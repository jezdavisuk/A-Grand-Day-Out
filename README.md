## A-Grand-Day-Out 

### Background
Wallace lands his rocket on some part of the Moon. Gromit warns him not to leave the rocket but dear Wallace has grown mightily hungry from his long journey and is eager to sample the local delicacy. Gromit's highly sensitive nose tells him that there is indeed an accumulation of extraterrestrial cheddar somewhere nearby of extraterrestrial Wensleydale, Wallace's favourite.  To get there, Wallace can make any number of steps in any one of the four cardinal directions that mark his compass; that is, North, East, South, and West. There is no limit on the number of steps that Wallace makes. At the end of any sequence of steps, Wallace looks to Gromit who gives a qualitative assessment of just how near they are to their coveted curd of choice.

Short on supplies and time, Wallace & Gromit agree to stay within the confines of a map of the area that Wallace had drawn up in haste from his visit in 1989. Thus, while there is no limit of the number of successive steps that Wallace makes, he can not stray so far as to enter uncharted territory. It is known that the area mapped is home to an inimical moon machine who seeks to exact revenge for his abandonment some 25 years ago. For that reason, the pair must tread carefully.

Our mission is to see if we can guide Wallace safely to this promising bounty of moon cheese and to not cross paths with their mechanical foe in the process.
